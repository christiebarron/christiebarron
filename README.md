- 👋 Hi, I’m @christiebarron
- 👀 I’m interested in educational assessment and measurement. I'm an aspiring Data Analyst and Psychometrician. Thus far, I use R as my main programming language. I routinely use Mplus for statistical modeling too. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R and Python broadly. Slowly dipping my toes into SQL as well. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on statistical analyses related to factor analysis, structural equation modeling, mixture modeling, item response theory, and diagnostic classification modeling.
- 📫 How to reach me email me at christie.m.barron@gmail.com
